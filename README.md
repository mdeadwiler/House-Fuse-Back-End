## ***About:***

* Our project is a full-stack & job-posting platform that bridges the gap between homeowners and contractors for essential home services. With an intuitive interface, Home Fuze enables homeowners to post jobs for specific needs-like roofing, plumbing, electrical work, and remodeling. 
* Now, contractors can then browsw these listings and submit competitive bids. This includes, pricing, timelines, and contract information.
* Designed with comprehensive CRUD functionalities, Home Fuze allows users to create, update, and delete job posts, bids, and comments, fostering an efficient and transparent space for home improvement services.

***How it Started:***
* This project was based on four entry level software engineers who wanted to build an impactful & practical application. Our goal was to address the communication challenges homeowners often face in finding reliable contractors, while giving contractors a centralized platform to access new job opportunities. With Home Fuze, we aimed to streamline the entire process-empowering homeowners and contractors to share job details, negotiate terms, and exchange feedback all in one place. Using our skills in React, MongoDB, and Express, we built Home Fuze to emphasize user-friendly navigation, organized data management, and a seamless bidding process that benefits all parties.

### ***Key Features***
* Job Posting & Management: Homeowners can create, update, and delete job posts for various services (roofing, plumbing, electrical, remodeling).

* Contractor Bidding: Contractors can submit bids with estimated prices, timelines, and additional details, allowing for a competitive process.

* Comments & Reviews: Both homeowners and contractors can post and view comments on job posts, enabling transparent communication and feedback.

* Data Organization: Pre-set categories simplify job posting, and all bids, comments, and contractor information are displayed on the job's page for easy navigation. 

* CRUD Functionalities: Robust capabilities for creating, updating, and deleting job posts, bids, and comments across the platform.

#### ***Tech Stack***
* Frontend: React (UI and component-based structure), React Router (navigation), Axios (API calls)
* Backend: Node.js with Express (API and server logic)
* Database: MongoDB (data storage for jobs, contractors, bids, and comments)
* Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) 
* Deployment: Netlify (frontend) and Heroku (backend)




 ***Roadmap***
* Setup: Define goals, set up Git, initialize React, Node.js, MongoDB.
* Frontend: Build landing page, job post form, job listing/detail views.
* Backend: Set up Express server, MongoDB models, CRUD routes for jobs, bids, and comments.
* User Interactions: Implement bid and comment forms.
* Authentication: Add JWT login and role-based access.
* Final Touches: Style UI, add feedback, test, and deploy (Heroku/Netlify).
